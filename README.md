NetVinylGLFW
====================
This is a small experiment application used to explore functional reactive game programming in Haskell using the Netwire, Vinyl, Vinyl-GL, Lens, Linear and GLFW packages. I is also did it to have something for show and tell at my functional programming users group.

**Disclaimer**: If you accidentally stumble upon this page do take note that I am still a novice Haskaller, and that I am capturing here my limited understanding of things, but hopefully you might find something valuable here like I have when I stumbled upon so many other resources. On that note here is a list of some resources (that I can remember) that helped me.
